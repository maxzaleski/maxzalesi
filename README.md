# Hello there! 👋

I’m a self-taught software engineer from London, UK. 

I tend to lean more towards the backend side of the spectrum; however, I am comfortable in a full-stack environment having worked on large Angular/React applications in the past.

Most of the projects on my profile are from **2018/2019** (see dated license).

## Currently

I am currently taking a 4 year hiatus to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.

In my spare time, I am working on an EdTech startup.
