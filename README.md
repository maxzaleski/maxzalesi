# Hello there! 👋

I'm a software engineer from London, UK. 

I would consider myself a backend engineer due to my strong interest in scalable distributed systems;
however, I am comfortable in a full-stack environment having worked on large Angular/React applications in the past.

Most of the projects on my profile are from **2018/2019**.
